Financial Data Reconciliation Report

Overall Reconciliation Summary

This report summarizes the reconciliation of transactions between the ERP data and the Bank Statement. The reconciliation process was automated using a Gen AI agentic framework.

- **Total ERP Transactions:** 200
- **Total Bank Statement Transactions:** 208
- **Successfully Matched Transactions:** 181

**Overall Reconciliation Rate:** 90.50%

Summary of Issues Found

The AI agent identified and classified the following discrepancies:

- **Amount Mismatches:** 7 transactions were found with matching Invoice IDs but differing amounts. This often occurs due to bank fees, currency exchange differences, or data entry errors.
- **Missing in Bank:** 20 transactions are present in the ERP but not on the bank statement. These may be timing differences (e.g., payments not yet cleared), unrecorded transactions, or pending ERP entries.
- **Missing in ERP:** 20 transactions are on the bank statement but not in the ERP. This could be due to unrecorded bank charges, direct deposits, or uncaptured sales.

Recommendations

Based on the findings, we recommend the following actions:

1.  **Investigate Amount Mismatches:** Manually review the 7 transactions with amount differences. The AI has pinpointed the exact Invoice IDs, making this process efficient.
2.  **Review Unmatched Transactions:** Investigate the 20 transactions missing from each source to determine if they are timing differences or true discrepancies that require manual entry or correction.
3.  **Improve Data Synchronization:** Consider implementing an automated feed between the bank and ERP system to reduce manual data entry and minimize timing-related discrepancies.
4.  **Enhance Data Descriptions:** If possible, standardize transaction descriptions in both systems to enable more robust fuzzy matching in the future.

This report demonstrates how a Gen AI framework can significantly automate the reconciliation process, pinpointing key discrepancies and providing actionable insights for financial teams.
